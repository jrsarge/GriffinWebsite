The design philosophy is "Minimalist Engineering" with two distinct themes (Forest and Bright).Code Style & ConventionsFunctional Components: Use arrow functions const Component = () => {}.Styling: Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively. Do not create separate .css files unless absolutely necessary for global resets.Icons: Use lucide-react.File Structure: * Components in src/components/.Data in src/data/.Pages in src/pages/.Imports: Use absolute imports or consistent relative imports.Build & Run Commandsnpm run dev - Start development server.npm run build - Build for production.npm run preview - Preview production build.npm run lint - Run ESLint.Behavior GuidelinesPreserve Data: When refactoring, never lose the hardcoded resume data (Griffin Rossberg, U of Utah, ACME Overland details).Responsiveness: Always ensure new UI elements work on mobile. Use Tailwind's md: and lg: prefixes.Accessibility: default to adding aria-labels to interactive elements.
