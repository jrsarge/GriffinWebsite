    description: 'Engineered a custom winch mounting system for ACME Overland\'s off-road vehicle line. Utilized SolidWorks to create detailed 3D models with precise GD&T specifications. Conducted structural analysis to ensure the mount could withstand 12,000 lbs of pulling force while maintaining a safety factor of 3:1.',
    problem: 'Existing aftermarket winch mounts had inconsistent quality and often failed under stress during recovery operations.',
    solution: 'Designed a reinforced steel bracket system with integrated fairlead mount. Used FEA to optimize material distribution, reducing weight by 15% while increasing load capacity.',
