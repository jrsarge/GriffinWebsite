User Stories & Claude Code PromptsSprint 1: FoundationStory 1.1: Component RefactoringAs a Developer,I want to break the single App.jsx file into smaller components,So that the code is maintainable and easier to debug.Acceptance Criteria:Navbar.jsx created.Footer.jsx created.ProjectCard.jsx created.Pages (Home, Projects, Resume, Contact) moved to /pages.Claude Code Prompt:"Refactor the existing single-file App.jsx. Create a new directory structure: src/components and src/pages. Move the navigation logic to src/components/Navbar.jsx, the footer to src/components/Footer.jsx, and create separate files for Home, Projects, Resume, and Contact views in the pages directory. Ensure props are passed correctly to maintain current functionality."Story 1.2: Data ExtractionAs a Content Manager,I want to separate text data from the rendering logic,So that I can easily update my resume or projects without risking breaking the UI code.Acceptance Criteria:src/data/projects.js contains project array.src/data/experience.js contains resume array.src/data/personalInfo.js contains contact info.Claude Code Prompt:"Extract the hardcoded arrays for projects, experience, awards, and personalInfo from the main component. Move them into separate JavaScript files in a src/data/ folder. Export them as constants and import them back into the relevant components to populate the UI."Sprint 2: Theming & LogicStory 2.1: Robust Theme SwitcherAs a User,I want the website to remember my theme preference (Forest vs. Bright),So that I don't have to toggle it every time I refresh the page.Acceptance Criteria:Theme state persists in localStorage.Theme toggle transitions are smooth (CSS transition).Colors map correctly to the Style Guide.Claude Code Prompt:"Enhance the existing theme logic. Use useEffect to save the selected theme ('forest' or 'bright') to localStorage whenever it changes. On initial load, check localStorage to set the initial state. Add a CSS transition class to the root container to ensure color changes fade in smoothly over 300ms."Sprint 3: Enterprise PolishStory 3.1: Accessibility (A11y) HardeningAs a Site Visitor with visual impairments,I want to navigate the site using a keyboard and screen reader,So that I can access the content regardless of ability.Acceptance Criteria:All buttons have aria-label where text isn't descriptive.Images have meaningful alt text.Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards.Tab order is logical.Claude Code Prompt:"Audit the current components for accessibility. Ensure all <button> elements, especially icon-only buttons like the Theme Toggle and Mobile Menu, have descriptive aria-label attributes. Verify that all images in the Project cards have alt tags sourced from the project title. Ensure outline rings are visible when elements are focused via keyboard."Story 3.2: SEO & Meta TagsAs a Job Seeker,I want my portfolio to look good when shared on LinkedIn,So that I attract more recruiters.Acceptance Criteria:Document title updates based on the active page.Open Graph (OG) meta tags added for Title, Description, and Image.Favicon added.Claude Code Prompt:"Add a useEffect hook to update document.title based on the active view (e.g., 'Projects | Griffin Rossberg'). Then, update the index.html to include standard Open Graph meta tags (og:title, og:description, og:image) so the link generates a preview card when shared on social media."
